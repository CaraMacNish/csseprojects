The retinal nerves are arranged in layers, and the disruption of these layers can provide evidence of systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension (coronary disease) and Alzheimers.

Our COVID-19 model was the first high-resolution COVID-19 model to be developed and applied in Australia, and one of the first world-wide. It uses an individual oriented agent-based modelling method and simulates COVID-19 transmission in models of specific communities, under alternative mitigation strategies. It allows the effectiveness of one strategy, such as vaccinating 80% of the population aged 12 and over, to be compared with another, say 70% of those aged 5 years and above, by simulating virus spread under each scenario. The age-specific infection data generated by the simulation software is then transformed into cases, hospitalisation and deaths (the health burden) using outbreak data from countries experiencing high transmission rates, such as the UK. This quantifies the reduction in hospitalisations and deaths that may be expected by high vaccination rates and/or application of lockdown measures, for example.\r\nThis modelling technology is highly sophisticated and currently requires experts to ‚Äúset up‚Äù the simulations and then manipulate the resulting output data to generate epidemic curves or tables, for example. How can the technology be made accessible by staff in any of Australia‚Äôs eight health departments? \r\nWhat is needed is user-friendly infrastructure to both input and output large amounts of data. This project‚Äôs aim is to develop an environment which will allow users to determine numbers of cases, hospitalisations and deaths prevented by a particular intervention strategy, thus providing metrics of the effectiveness of such a strategy. Such results allow optimal pandemic response policy to be determined, informed by running virtual outbreaks.\r\nThe environment should allow users to intuitively set-up simulation experiments, and do the following: \r\n1.\tselect specific intervention to be simulated, such as hard lockdown or 90% vaccination coverage\r\n2.\tselect underlying variant settings, such as reproduction number\r\n3.\tdetermine how results should be presented\r\n4.\trun the model\r\n5.\tcompare results with a baseline.", "short": "", "skills": "", "honours": true, "mds": true, "se": false, "engineering": false, "other": "", "numstudents": "", "primary": 27, "cosupervisor": 33, "external": "", "link": "", "references": "", "created": "2023-02-06", "modified": "2023-02-06", "current_date": "2021-12-13", "visible": true}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 36, "fields": {"title": "Game playing AI", "description": "Games a a great test bed and research environment for artificial intelligence.
